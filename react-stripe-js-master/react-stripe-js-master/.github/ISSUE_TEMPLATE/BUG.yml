        Thanks for taking the time to fill out this bug report! This project is a thin wrapper around [Stripe.js](https://stripe.com/docs/js). Please only file issues here that you believe represent bugs with the wrapper, not Stripe.js itself.

        If you're having general trouble with Stripe.js or your Stripe integration, please reach out to us using the form at https://support.stripe.com/email or come chat with us on the [Stripe Discord](https://discord.com/invite/stripe) server. We're very proud of our level of service, and we're more than happy to help you out with your integration.
